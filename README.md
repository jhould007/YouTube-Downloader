# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader
A simple python GUI program I wrote using the pytube and tkinter libraries to download YouTube playlists, since I was sick of trying various janky websites that never seemed to work properly.

# How to Use
1) Run the .exe file, located under dist/gui.exe. 
2) In the window that appears, paste your YouTube playlist URL.
3) Select either audio or video, depending on which you want.
4) Click the "download" button. 
5) Find your downloaded video/audio in the folder the .exe file was run in. For example, if you ran it in Downloads, that's where your downloaded files will appear. 
6) Enjoy!
