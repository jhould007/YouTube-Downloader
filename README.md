# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader
A simple python program I wrote using the pytube library to download YouTube playlists, since I was sick of trying various janky websites that never seemed to work properly.

# How to Use
1) Write a function call in one of the formats shown below, depending on if you want the playlist as video or audio only.
2) Open a terminal window and type "python download.py" without the quotes.
3) The videos will start downloading into the root directory. Once the process is done, you can move them wherever you like.
4) Enjoy!
