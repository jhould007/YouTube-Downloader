# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader
A simple python GUI program I wrote using the pytube and tkinter libraries to download YouTube playlists, since I was sick of trying various janky websites that never seemed to work properly.

# How to Use
1) Clone the repository. 
2) Open a terminal in the project's root directory, and run program.py by typing "python program.py". 
3) In the window that appears, paste your YouTube playlist URL.
4) Select either audio or video, depending on which you want.
5) Click the "download" button. 
6) Find your downloaded video/audio in a folder created in your Downloads folder. 
7) Enjoy!
