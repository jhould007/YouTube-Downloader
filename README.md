# YouTube-Downloader
A Python GUI program I wrote using the pytube and tkinter libraries to download YouTube videos or playlists in either video or audio format. Enables downloading playlists in 95% less time than free online video downloaders.

# How to Use
1) Clone the repository. 
2) Open a terminal in the project's root directory, and run program.py by typing "python program.py". 
3) In the window that appears, paste your YouTube video or playlist URL.
4) Select either audio or video, depending on which you want.
5) Click the "download" button. 
6) Find your downloaded video/audio in your downloads folder. 
  6a) If you downloaded a video, it will be in downloads. 
  6b) If you downloaded a playlist, a new folder with the playlist title will be created in downloads with your video/audio in it. 
7) Enjoy!

# New Features I'm Looking Into
* Checking if URLs are valid
* Improving visual design (font size, colors, emojis)
* Stop and pause buttons
* Song numbering when downloading playlists as audio
