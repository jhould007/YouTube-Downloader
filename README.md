# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader
A simple python GUI program I wrote using the pytube and tkinter libraries to download YouTube videos or playlists, since I was sick of trying various janky websites that never seemed to work properly.

# How to Use
1) Clone the repository. 
2) Open a terminal in the project's root directory, and run program.py by typing "python program.py". 
3) In the window that appears, paste your YouTube video or playlist URL.
4) Select either audio or video, depending on which you want.
5) Click the "download" button. 
6) Find your downloaded video/audio in your downloads folder. 
  6a) If you downloaded a video, it will be in downloads. 
  6b) If you downloaded a playlist, a new folder with the playlist title will be created in downloads with your video/audio in it. 
7) Enjoy!

# New Features I'm Looking Into
* Downloading audio as mp3 rather than mp4, as mp3 is a more common format for audio.
